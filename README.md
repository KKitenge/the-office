## Learning Points
* Syntax is extremely important
* Reading a diagram and converting that into the proper Primary/Foreign Key constraints and Groups was a bit hard. 
* Translating what I was seeing into JS was also a bit difficult and I didn't accomplish the full requirements.  
  
For Example, in the MySql shell, the table view for employees included all information:  
  
  ![mySql](/assets/sqlemptable.png)  
    
But I couldn't get it to show in the terminal and wasn't able to correct it.  
    ![terminal](/assets/terminalemptable.png)  

this then affected adding an employee, as an error was received. With more time, this can be understood and corrected.
